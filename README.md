The rapid growth of cryptocurrency markets has intensified the need for robust anomaly detection methods to identify abnormal trading patterns and potential market manipulation. This study investigates the effectiveness of different DL approaches for detecting anomalies in cryptocurrency market data. Specifically, we compare three models:

 -f-AnoGAN, a generative adversarial network designed for unsupervised anomaly detection
 
-Genetic algorithm-optimized extended Isolation Forest combined with a Support Vector Machine (SVM)

-Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network trained with a deep Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) loss.
 
The models are evaluated on two distinct types of market data: Level 1 data, comprising basic price and volume information, and Level 2 order book data, containing detailed bid-ask structures.

To facilitate comparison and interpretability, dimensionality reduction techniques including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) are applied to visualize the clustering of normal and anomalous observations. Our results provide insights into the relative utility of Level 1 versus Level 2 data for anomaly detection in cryptocurrency markets, and highlight the strengths and limitations of each modeling approach in capturing abnormal trading behaviors. The study aims to inform both academic research and practical applications in market surveillance, algorithmic trading, and financial risk management.
